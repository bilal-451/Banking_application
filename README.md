# Banking_application
In this project, I learn how to create a mini-application for a banking system in Java. In this program, I will add some
basic functionalities of a bank account like a deposit of amount, withdrawal of amount, etc.

Initially, the program accepts the number of customers we need to add and adds the customer.Further, it displays the series 
of menus to operate over the accounts.

The series of menus displayed are as follows:

1. Balance in the account
2. Deposit the amount
3. Withdraw the amount
4. Previous Transactions
5. Exit
